<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

In this paper, we design and build a multi-light source illumination and acquisition system for acquiring images of workpieces under a single illumination direction. On this basis, we propose a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) model specifically designed to process image data under multilight source illumination conditions to achieve high-precision classification of highly reflective metal surface defects.
